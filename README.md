Face Detection using OpenCV		
This is a simple Python project that uses OpenCV for face detection in real-time from webcam input. The project demonstrates how computer vision can be used to detect faces in images or video streams.

Abstract
This project implements a face detection system using OpenCV, a powerful computer vision library. The Haar Cascade classifier is used to identify and detect faces in a video feed. The application is lightweight, efficient, and suitable for real-time use cases like surveillance, face tracking, or as a building block for facial recognition systems.

Key Features
Real-time face detection using a webcam.
Easy-to-use and lightweight implementation.
Customisable for various image/video inputs.
Built with Python and OpenCV, making it platform-independent.

Setup Instructions
Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local system:

Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/C4lie/Face-recognizer.git
cd Face-recognizer

Install Dependencies
Make sure Python 3.x is installed on your system. Then, install the required libraries:
pip install opencv-python opencv-python-headless numpy

Run the Project
Execute the Python script to start the face detection program:
python main.py

Usage
The program will open a webcam feed.
Detected faces will be highlighted with rectangles.
Close the application by pressing q or stopping the terminal execution.

Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: OpenCV, NumPy
Tools: Haar Cascade for face detection
